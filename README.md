# Merazi's Bash Configuration Files

## What is this?
This is my bash configuration, aliases and functions.

## Why is this?
I don't want to lose them.

## How do I use this?
There's an installer script, it will create symbolic links to the original
files (the ones inside this directory).

## What makes this configuration file special?
- It is mine.
- Cool minimal prompt.
- I built this configuration thanks to:
  + https://mrzool.cc/writing/sensible-bash/
  + https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/
- Separated aliases and functions files.
- Some useful aliases, like file "bookmarks" and such.
- Some useful functions, like webm-to-ogg converter.

# WARNING!

For the installer to succeed you need to delete or move your `~/.bashrc`
`~/.bash-aliases` `~/.profile` and `~/.bash-functions` files.
