			| Bash configuration |

* What is this?
This is my bash configuration, aliases and functions.

* Why is this?
I don't want to lose them.

* How do I use this?
There's an installer script, it will create symbolic links to the original
files (the ones inside this directory).

! WARNING !
-----------

For the installer to succeed you need to delete or move your ~/.bashrc
~/.bash-aliases ~/.profile and ~/.bash-functions files.

Also you're going to need the Starship.rs prompt since I'm using it on my confs,
you can get starship.rs from this url: https://starship.rs/. Just follow the
instructions on the website and then copy my bashrc.

* What makes this configuration file special?
- It is mine.
- Cool starthip.rs prompt.
- I built this configuration thanks to:
  + https://mrzool.cc/writing/sensible-bash/
  + https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/
- Separated aliases and functions files.
- Some useful aliases, like file "bookmarks" and such.
- Some useful functions, like webm-to-ogg converter.
