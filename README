			| Bash configuration |

* What is this?
This is my bash configuration, aliases and functions.

* Why is this?
I don't want to lose them.

* How do I use this?
There's an installer script, it will create symbolic links to the original
files (the ones inside this directory).

! WARNING !
-----------

For the installer to succeed you need to delete or move your ~/.bashrc
~/.bash-aliases ~/.profile and ~/.bash-functions files.

* What makes this configuration file special?
- It is mine.
- Cool prompt that changes color according to the exit status of the last
command.
- I built this configuration thanks to:
+ https://mrzool.cc/writing/sensible-bash/
+ https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Controlling-the-Prompt.html#Controlling-the-Prompt
- Separated aliases and functions files.
- Some useful aliases, like file "bookmarks" and such.
- Some useful functions, like webm-to-ogg converter and a file extracter.
