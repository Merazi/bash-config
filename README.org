#+TITLE: Bash configuration
#+AUTHOR: Merazi

* What is this?
This is my bash configuration, aliases and functions.

* Why is this?
I don't want to lose them.

* How do I use this?
There's an installer script, it will create symbolic links to the original files (the ones inside this directory). =WARNING= for the installer to succeed you'll need to delete or move your =~/.bashrc= =~/.bash_aliases= and =~/.bash_functions= files.

* What makes this configuration file special?
- It is mine.
- Cool prompt collection.
- Saner defaults thanks to:
  - [[https://mrzool.cc/writing/sensible-bash/][Nice post by Mattia Tezzele]]
  - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Controlling-the-Prompt.html#Controlling-the-Prompt][The good old GNU manual about bash]]
- Separated aliases and functions files.
- Some useful aliases, like file "bookmarks" and such.
- Some useful functions, like webm-to-ogg converter and a file extracter.
